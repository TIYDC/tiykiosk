  <h4>H-TOWN UNDERGROUND</h4>
  <p>
    H-Town Underground is a movement to bring light to the superb free events our city has to offer. Users can quickly make their evening or weekend plans without the frustration of searching multiple websites, and businesses are able to submit an event in order to hit their target audience: those looking for the best events in Houston, without the price tag.

  <h4>DISHES IN MONTROSE</h4>
  <p>
    Dishes in Montrose allows foodies to search for dishes at restaurants in one of Houston's most food-obsessed neighborhoods based on what ingredients they love or want to avoid. This app solves foodies' frustration with sites that do not break menu information into separate dishes or allow searching a menu for dish options that exclude possible allergens. A search on Dishes in Montrose will return dishes on flippable cards that include photos, a map of the restaurant location, ingredients included and the ability to upvote tasty dishes.

  <h4>SYMPHONIC LINKUP</h4>
  <p>
    Anytime you want to listen to a particular classical piece live, you have to check your local symphony's website and hope that it's being performed this year.  My goal was to create an app that allowed a central location for users to check to see if a particular piece was being performed, not just by a local symphony, but any symphony.

Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a tabletop role-playing game (RPG) produced by Wizards of the Coast. Despite its complex ruleset, D&D remains largely a pencil-and-paper-and-rulebook game with few, if any, digital tools existing to create and track characters over multiple games. As gamers, we made a product that we ourselves would use for this purpose.

  <h4>CURTAIN UP HOUSTON</h4>
  <p>
    Houston is a great city to experience live theatre. The Alley and Hobby Center are wonderful, large playhouses downtown. But what if downtown Houston is a far commute or tickets to one of the larger venues are not in the budget? There is more than likely a community theatre close to you which you don't even know about. Curtain Up Houston aims to change that. Houston has a thriving community theatre scene that everyone should know about and be a part of. Simply enter your location and get connected with theatre in your area! If you are a venue or theatre company and want to be more exposed to the public you can sign up and make a profile that everyone can see!

  <p>
    
There were a few reasons behind the creation of the app. First, I really wanted a way to track my workouts and I didn't want to carry a notebook around at the gym. Secondly, I thought back to when I was a teen and I Idolized great athletes and wondered what type of workouts they did. Lastly to solve a problem for those who want to workout but just don't know what to do.

  <h4>MY PRESCRIPTION PAL</h4>
  <p>
    More than 100 million Americans live with chronic pain.  To help facilitate a more meaningful conversation between doctors and patients about pain, I have developed My Prescription Pal.  This web app tracks the amount taken and pain scale for each dose a patient takes.  Over time, doctors will be able to see whether the patient's current medication is working and whether a patient is showing early signs of addiction or abuse.

  <h3>Back End Engineering - Ruby on Rails</h3>
  <p>
    <img src="https://www.theironyard.com/content/dam/theironyard/icons/icon-BackEnd-update.png" />
  </p>
  <p>
    Back End Engineering focuses on the logic and database needs required to run and scale web applications. Back End products combine databases, APIs, and user interface frameworks. Backend developers deploy fully formed products to the cloud, integrate with online services, and enable mobile and front end applications.
  </p>

  <h3>Front End Engineering - Javascript</h3>
  <p>
    <img src="https://www.theironyard.com/content/dam/theironyard/icons/icon-FrontEnd-update.png" />
  </p>
  <p>
    Front End Engineering focuses on creating experiences in web browsers that users see and interact with. The discipline covers a broad area, from web design principles to complex JavaScript applications that manage data. The tools used in Front End Engineering are ubiquitous—no matter the technology used on the Back End, Front-Enders are responsible for delivering the experience and data to the person using the web application.
