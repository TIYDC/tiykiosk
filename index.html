  <h3>Meetups This Week Worth Considering</h3>
  <h4>The Hacker Society</h4>
  <h5>Tue, Sep 01 -  5:30PM</h5>

  <em>Hands-On Hack Night</em>

  <em><p>We'll be continuing work on <a href="https://github.com/poetic/ember-cli-cordova">Cordova</a> and <a href="https://github.com/poetic/short-stack">Short Stack</a>. When you get here you'll get to pick which project you want to work on. You don't get to pick the music. That's sacred.</p> <p>First time members may be blindfolded and spun then asked to throw a poison tipped dart at a project leader. Whichever one doesn't get hit gets to keep you on their team. Then you're gonna code and learn with awesome developers who probably had a shower...maybe.</p> <p>Space is limited but ideas aren't. RSVP below.</p></em>
