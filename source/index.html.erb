          </p>
          <p>
            Back End Engineering focuses on the logic and database needs required to run and scale web applications. Back End products combine databases, APIs, and user interface frameworks. Backend developers deploy fully formed products to the cloud, integrate with online services, and enable mobile and front end applications.

        <section>
          <h3>Front End Engineering - Javascript</h3>
          <p>
            <%= image_tag "http://theironyard.com/images/courses/icons/front-end-engineering-icon.png" %>
          </p>
          <p>
            Front End Engineering focuses on creating experiences in web browsers that users see and interact with. The discipline covers a broad area, from web design principles to complex JavaScript applications that manage data. The tools used in Front End Engineering are ubiquitousâ€”no matter the technology used on the Back End, Front-Enders are responsible for delivering the experience and data to the person using the web application.
